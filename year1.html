      For my first project, I had to create a 2d platformer with the basic mechanics of walk, run, jump with collectible objects and jump pads. I used premade art as I'm not the greatest at 2D art, so I mainly focused on the coding side of the project. I created a narrative system and custom boss fight with multiple attacks for this project. I enjoyed creating this game as I was able to experiment with different types of movement mechanics when chained together.

      For this project I had to create a 3D Escape Room with puzzles and keys that the player must solve and find to be able to escape. Even though this didnt look very appealing the fuctionality of the game was there and was fun to play there was a few bugs with UI not disappearing and the jumpscares being very basic. From people playtesting they still enjoyed playing my game just as much as I enjoyed creating it.

      For my FMP I created a multiplayer prop hunt game that can have up to 10 people playing using local multiplayer, I modelled my college games hub for the level and used premade assets for the models, There was a few bugs with audio replication being qlitchy and sometimes the player didnt switch back from a prop for everyone in the game but other than that everyone who played had tons of fun playing this game trying to find people or hiding as a prop and seeing what crazy spots they could find.
