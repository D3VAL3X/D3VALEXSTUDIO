     Currently I am working on developing my technical and creative skills as a game developer to level up my skills to make me more employable to companies that follow an industry standard workflow, I am confidently and quickly improving my skills within Unreal Engine with creating complex and simple core systems, as well as tricky mechanics i am also able to do projects like Website Development to create cool and functional websites when aligning this with the entry level for the industry standard for most companies my skills alone do not fully align with this standard but when combining these skills with my ability to learn quickly and having the ability to apply and adapt feedback to improve my technical and creative skills within the work I am producing. I still need to improve some of my creative skills when it comes to being able to tell a story with interesting narrative design as they are my biggest weakness within the industry. I am also able to use multiple different Software at a comfortable level when doing video editing on premiere pro and clip champ but to be able to work at a industry level I need to improve my skills within using these types of software. With my technical skills using Unreal Engine and 3D Modelling Software like Blender and 3DS Max are at a more intermediate level and more acceptable for the industry workflow as I am able to code any mechanic im asked and model most assets that might need modelling. With the skills that I currently have I am able to use these in the industry world. Knowing the knowledge in multiple languages for example being able to code in  C# and C++  to program complex systems and mechanics inside of different game engines and software. However when it comes to my professional skills I have a very strong skillset for the industry workflow with being able to complete projects in a set time frame as well as being able to solve any tricky tasks I might face wether that is debugging code or coming up with fun mechanics for games industrys to use as well as being able too adapt to any new tools I might have to use for example when having to learn how to use 3DS Max and how different it was to blender and having to adapt my knowledge and skills to fit this new software. As well as my skills in other languages like Python, HTML, CSS as well as Javascript within Web Development, API and Bot programming and being able to combine all these languages to create one master project has allowed me to be more diverse in what projects, I can work on when comparing this to the industry standard being able to code in multiple different languages can make me more available and interested in by more companies as I'm more diverse in my ability to complete different tasks within a set time frame given to me by any company.

      I would like to study for this course because I have always enjoyed playing and creating video games from a young age. Which has helped me to improve my skills and creativity in different styles of games production. I have then been able to explore every aspect that goes into creating games at a professional level during my time at college. This course would be a good fit for me as it will help me work towards my goals for the future. All these skills will then help me with my future goal of being a solo indie developer. My qualifications and studies has helped me prepare for this course as it has helped me understand how much detail goes into designing, coding and creating games overall. College has helped me to learn how to ensure my written work is at it's highest quality. It has also helped me understand the amount of work that needs to be completed, how to break the concept, design and creating of a game into sections and how to complete this in a set time frame. Learning 3ds Max and Blender has taught me how the industry standard workflow works with creating models for example with learning how to model characters in low poly as well as basic building asset kits including walls, windows and doors. Also attending Games Con has also inspired me to create different styles of games than I usually would go for, During my visit there I was able to look at different style of games that people have made and wanted people to playtest.

    <p>Outside of education I have learnt how to proficiently code in HTML, CSS,  PYTHON, JAVA, C++, C#, GDSCRIPT Node.JS learning these languages had some challenges such as cross language interference, My biggest challenge I faced with learning all the languages was remembering how to code in all of them as I struggle to remember languages like C++ and C# because I don't use that language anymore. Another challenge I faced was learning how these languages can work together for example HTML is for web development and CSS is for styling as well as Java Script can be used to link external APIs to a website.  I have also taught myself how to use Unity, Unreal Engine and Godot Engine. I have learnt how to create discord bots for servers as well as creating websites to showcase work that I have completed or worked on throughout my game development journey so far.</p>
