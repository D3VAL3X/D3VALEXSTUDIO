      I would like to study for this course because I have always enjoyed playing and creating video games from a young age. Which has helped me to improve my skills and creativity in different styles of games production. I have then been able to explore every aspect that goes into creating games at a professional level during my time at college. This course would be a good fit for me as it will help me work towards my goals for the future. All these skills will then help me with my future goal of being a solo indie developer. My qualifications and studies has helped me prepare for this course as it has helped me understand how much detail goes into designing, coding and creating games overall. College has helped me to learn how to ensure my written work is at it's highest quality. It has also helped me understand the amount of work that needs to be completed, how to break the concept, design and creating of a game into sections and how to complete this in a set time frame. Learning 3ds Max and Blender has taught me how the industry standard workflow works with creating models for example with learning how to model characters in low poly as well as basic building asset kits including walls, windows and doors. Also attending Games Con has also inspired me to create different styles of games than I usually would go for, During my visit there I was able to look at different style of games that people have made and wanted people to playtest.

    <p>Outside of education I have learnt how to proficiently code in HTML, CSS,  PYTHON, JAVA, C++, C#, GDSCRIPT Node.JS learning these languages had some challenges such as cross language interference, My biggest challenge I faced with learning all the languages was remembering how to code in all of them as I struggle to remember languages like C++ and C# because I don't use that language anymore. Another challenge I faced was learning how these languages can work together for example HTML is for web development and CSS is for styling as well as Java Script can be used to link external APIs to a website.  I have also taught myself how to use Unity, Unreal Engine and Godot Engine. I have learnt how to create discord bots for servers as well as creating websites to showcase work that I have completed or worked on throughout my game development journey so far.</p>
